<p class='c003'><a id='Page_1'></a>There is no work, of human production, that contains
such a variety of principles, which, when viewed as a
whole, make such a complete system as the Bible. It is
the great fund of knowledge. It reveals to us the mystery
of creation. There we learn the character of God:&mdash;His
attributes and perfection&mdash;His justice and mercy. There
we learn the history of man&mdash;created as he was in the
image of Him who rules the universe; endowed with
intellectual powers, and moral capacity, perfect and upright&mdash;a
candidate for immortality. Restrained by one
command, yet acting with a free, unbiased will, we see him
transcend the law of God, we hear the sentence fall from
the lips of his "Maker,"&mdash;"Dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return." But will He leave him to his own
inevitable fate? Will it be an eternal sleep? Shall that
dust never be reorganized? Will Satan triumph over the
"Eternal Jehovah?" We look! We listen!! We hear
the announcement, <i>I have found a ransom</i>. There we see
the "plan of God" developed, counteracting the influence
of His rival, Satan. There we see men of the meanest
condition, the smallest capacity in the eye of the world,
inspired by the spirit of Him who fills immensity with His
presence; revealing the fact of man's salvation, through
<a id='Page_2'></a>a crucified Saviour. There we behold the most sublime
truths&mdash;the most comprehensive sentiments; principles
more philosophical than those of "Pythagoras"&mdash;of more
moral worth, than those of "Socrates." There we see
shepherds, announcing the birth of the Son of God, and
listening to that enraptured strain, "Glory to God in the
highest, peace on earth, good will to men." There we see
the "Fisherman" called to leave his net, commissioned to
cure all manner of diseases, and to preach the "Gospel,
which is the power of God unto salvation, to every one
that believeth." "There we admire the purest morality in
the world." The "Bible" accounts for the evils entailed
upon the posterity of Adam; it presents a plan, which, if
believed, will ultimately free us from all the maladies consequent
on the fall. There we read of the wonderful
conception of the Son of God&mdash;His birth&mdash;His miracles.
The fulfillment of the many predictions, connected with
His first Advent; the circumstances attending His death,
when "He made his soul an offering for sin;" His resurrection,
His ascension, His intercession, His second coming,
the judgment of the world, the resurrection of the dead,
the translation of the saints, the destruction of the wicked,
the establishment of the everlasting kingdom, "the restitution
of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of
all His holy prophets, since the world began."</p>

<p class='c004'>The above are some of the items contained in this <i>wonderful</i>
book&mdash;the "Bible." And who can wonder at the
remark of Paul to Timothy, They (the "Scriptures") are
able to make thee wise unto salvation? "All Scripture,"
says the apostle, "given by inspiration of God, is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect,&mdash;thoroughly
furnished unto all good works." Instead of
<a id='Page_3'></a>looking to commentaries, or depending on what the <i>Fathers</i>
of the Church have said for doctrine, or making creeds for
our own use; we are to <i>search the Scriptures</i>&mdash;relying on
what has been spoken by the Saviour and the "Prophets,"
and the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only doctrine
able to make us "wise unto salvation."</p>

<p class='c004'>But the apostle goes further, and declares, that the
Scriptures are profitable for reproof; they are able to
convince men of the truth, and to confound those who
would deny it. Says Charles Beecher,&mdash;"This specification,"
viz: <i>for reproof</i>, "fairly covers the whole ground of
the prevention or extirpation of error." In familiar language,
the keeping the Church pure from heresy. That
this is the force of the term "<i>Elenychon</i>," will be perceived
by any one who will compare the "New Testament"
usage on this word, and its parent verb. The
Bible will not only teach truth; it will kill error. It may
not kill every thing that you and I may consider error. It
certainly will, when used rightly, extirpate what God
regards as such; and, be it remembered, that He alone is
to pass that sentence. That the Bible will have this effect,
follows of course from the first specification, viz: for doctrine;
for truth and error cannot exist together: they are
as fire and water. The more truth is taught, the more
error dies. This also follows, because the Word of God
is constructed with direct reference to the cardinal errors
of the human mind, by a divine reasoner, with such tremendous
ability, that those errors cannot live under a
conscientious study of that word. This also follows,
because the Scriptures are self-interpreting, self-rectifying,
self-vindicating. And the sure way of testing an error
claiming scriptural support, is, call it to the spot where it
claims parentage, and call in the rest of the Scripture to
<a id='Page_4'></a>testify. In this way, erroneous interpretations must die,
and do die. And if there be any interpretation that will
not die so, then "in God's name let it live!" How foolish
it is for a class of persons to get together in conference
capacity, and resolve what is and what is not truth! It is
assuming that which does not belong to any man, or body
of men; it is a relic of the "Roman Church,"&mdash;an usurpation
of the "Mother of harlots, and abominations of the
earth." And notwithstanding this power has been crippled,
at least in a political sense, yet, some of her relatives
("harlots") are "following in the footsteps of their illustrious
predecessor," as the following will show:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Resolved</i>, That the peculiarities of that theory denominated <i>Millerism</i>,
together with all of its modifications, are contrary to the standards
of the Church, and as such, we are pledged to banish them away."</p>

<p class='c004'>There is nothing said about its being contrary to the
Bible, but, contrary to the <i>standards of the Church</i>. This,
as one writer remarks, "savors a little of the little horn."</p>

<p class='c004'><i>For Correction.</i>&mdash;This relates to church discipline, and
church government. "There is not," says Charles Beecher,
"an offence against Christ, nor against the cause of Christ,
whether in the church simple, or aggregate, which cannot
be brought to conviction just as far, by the use of the Bible
alone, as God ever intended to have it convicted; and if
there be an offence which cannot be thus convicted, it is
not an offence against Christ, but against a human figment,
and such an offence&mdash;let it be committed." If the Bible is
a sufficient rule of faith and practice, every thing used as
a substitute is an innovation. We have no right to make
any <i>tests</i>; all that are necessary to salvation, may be
found in the Bible.</p>

<p class='c004'>All creeds, from the Thirty-nine Articles down to the
<a id='Page_5'></a>most simple, as used by Adventists, are wrong. Not that
they contain no truth; but the principle is wrong. It is
the same in every instance. A person, to join the Church
of England, must approve of its creed;&mdash;and it is the same
with some Adventists, as the following from one of our
model Churches will show:</p>

<p class='c004'>"<span class='fss'>ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WISHING TO BECOME MEMBERS
OF THIS CHURCH, APPROVING ITS DECLARATION OF FAITH AS
RECORDED IN THE CHURCH-BOOK, WILL MAKE SUCH WISH
KNOWN TO THE COMMITTEE OR DEACON.</span>"</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, this is an iron bedstead, sure enough. Mark!
there is nothing said about the Bible, but approving the
declaration of faith, as recorded in the Church-book.
Where in the Bible is there any thing of this kind? Luke
tells us, in Acts, that the Lord added to the Church
anciently; and those added by any other than the Lord,
must be tares. And again, if this idea of connecting persons
with this human machinery, is a part of the gospel,
why then is there not something in the Bible to support it?
The example of Philip is against it. Look for a moment
to this circumstance. The angel says to Philip, "Arise,
and go toward the south, unto the way that goeth down
from Jerusalem, unto Gaza, which is desert." He obeys
the command, and as he moves toward Gaza, he overtakes
or meets with the "Egyptian Eunuch." The Spirit says,
"Join thyself to the chariot." He did so, and after listening
a few moments, he inquires, "Understandest thou what
thou readest?" "How can I, except some man should
guide me?" was the reply. Then Philip began to preach
to him Jesus. And as they went on their way, the Ethiopian
inquires, "What doth hinder me to be baptized?"
And Philip said, "If thou believest with all thy heart, thou
mayest." He replies, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the
<a id='Page_6'></a>Son of God." This was the test. The chariot is commanded
to stand still; they went down both into the water,
and Philip baptized him. And when they were come out
of the water, before, as we may conclude, he had time to
enter his name on a Church-book, "the Spirit of the Lord
caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more."
There is nothing said about his joining the Church after he
believed; from the fact that, <i>by obedience to God</i>, he
already belonged to it. He had entered in by the door
(Christ), and all who climb up some other way "are
thieves and robbers." But it may be said that we must
have something of this kind, because circumstances demand
it. But this can be no argument in favor of it; for, if it had
been necessary, the apostles would have informed us of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The apostle, in his charge to the Elders of the Church
at Ephesus, scans the entire dispensation. It is as follows:
"Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock over the
which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the
Church of God, which He hath purchased with His own
blood. For I know this, that after my departing, shall
grievous wolves come in among you, not sparing the flock.
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore,
watch, and remember, that by the space of three years, I
ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the
word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to
give you an inheritance among them which are sanctified."
One part of this charge is addressed to the ministry. Take
heed unto thyself&mdash;or yourselves; "see that the life of God
remains, and the work of God prospers in thine own soul."
Take heed that thy words be seasoned with grace. Let
thy conversation be upright, godly, sincere, as becometh
<a id='Page_7'></a>the Gospel. It should be without covetousness: "Desire
nothing more than what God has given you, and especially,
covet nothing which the Divine Providence has given to
another man; for this is the <i>spirit of robbery</i>." Subdue
that insatiable desire for secular gain; bring it into subjection
to the will of Christ; be content with such things as
ye have; for He (the Lord) hath said, I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee. The man of God must not be a
"brawler," but quiet and peaceable. He must be no
"striker," not quarrelsome; not a persecutor of those who
may differ from him; for, to indulge in such a spirit, is to
give our profession the lie. He must be apt to teach.
"Study," says the apostle, "to show thyself approved unto
God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth." He must be careful to teach
the <i>whole</i> word of God, regardless of the commandments,
doctrine and traditions of men. In a word, he must be an
example of believers in word, in conversation, in charity,
in spirit, in faith, and in purity. And thus, in keeping
himself by the assistance of God's grace, he is prepared, in
the second place, to take heed unto the flock, over the
which the Holy Ghost hath made him an overseer; to feed
the Church of God. Mark! the man of God is to feed the
Church&mdash;not to legislate. He is to give them (the Church)
"their portion of meat in due season."</p>

<p class='c004'>The apostle anticipated the fact, that a class would arise,
which he denominates wolves, not sparing the flock. One
characteristic feature of this class would be, a disposition
to lord it over God's heritage. The seed had already been
sown. Some had become carnal. There was a "Diatrephes,"
who loved to have the preëminence, viz.: "lord it
over God's heritage." And there has been many of these
"Diatrepheses," clear down to the present time. Look at
<a id='Page_8'></a>the Bishops of Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome, Constantinople,
&amp;c., striving for the mastery; till finally the Bishop of
Rome succeeded, trampling under foot all others, and then
rearing a mighty fabric, and taking his seat in the temple
of God, showing himself that he was God. But we must
remember that this was not done in one year, or one century.
It was like the leaven in the measure of meal&mdash;a
gradual work. The deviation was so small at the first, as
not to be noticed. The professed Church were imperceptibly
assimilated into the same spirit; like priest, like people.
Like the car loosed from the train on a downward grade:&mdash;at
first it moves so gently, no fears are entertained&mdash;how
little will it take to stop it, is the feeling that pervades the
mind of the passengers; each one feels secure. It gathers
strength&mdash;its velocity increases&mdash;the brakes are applied;
but it is too late! In turning a curve, the track spreads,
and both car and passengers are precipitated into the gulf
below. How completely this illustration covers the ground!
The professed Church, becoming cold in her affections,
indulging a self-confident spirit, disconnecting herself by
her legislative acts from the Great Head of the Church;
went back, step by step, till finally she fell into the yawning
gulf of apostacy, "The making of an authoritative
creed, to which the clergy were compelled to subscribe,
was the first step; the absolute prohibition of the Bible to
the people, was the last step. The difference between, was
only the growth of the principle. For the right to dictate
what a man shall find in the Scripture, and the right to
dictate that he shall find nothing, are one." Making creeds
is the first step in apostacy; yea, more, it is evidence that
the person or persons are already backsliden.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be remarked, that those who make creeds are
honest. True: but no more so than those Bishops who
<a id='Page_9'></a>met at the "Council of Nice," A.D. 325, "and fully settled
the doctrine taught in the word of God, banished Arius
into Illyria, and compelled his followers to subscribe."
Honesty is no evidence that the thing is right. The "Inquisition"
was honest in delivering over her victims to the
civil arm; yet, who but a Catholic would approve of such
God-hating work? It may be remarked that, there is a
difference between the synods of Nice, Chalcedon, &amp;c., and
those of the present time. True; but what is the difference?
<i>Ans.</i> The same as between the Anaconda of Ceylon,
and the smallest serpent that crawls the earth. The
former has power to destroy a person in a moment; the
latter, not having the power, yet possessing the disposition,
shows, by running out his little <i>forked tongue</i>, what he
would do if he could.</p>

<p class='c004'>"The apostolic churches, during the whole of the first
century, had no creed but the Bible." And to urge creed-making
as necessary because of a change of circumstances,
is to insult God, and it is an imposition on Jesus Christ.
The Lord knew all about the adverse circumstances, the
fiery trials through which the Church must pass. He told
the disciples, "that in the world they should have tribulation."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you that ye shall weep
and lament." In this language, He scans the history of
the Church, clear to the end. But nothing like authority
or lenity is given for creeds, or any of this human
machinery. The Apostle Paul informs the Church, that
men "would arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away
disciples after them." And if ever an opportunity offered
itself to instruct the Church in relation to this matter, it
was at this time. But not a single word is said from which
we can gather any thing of this kind. It is as follows:
"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the
<a id='Page_10'></a>word of his grace, which is able to build you up." No
intimation here of creeds or compacts. And if men will
not stand without this miserable man-made stuff, the quicker
they fall, the better.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it is not only so with creeds, but every organization
and compact, separate from the word of God, is of the flesh.
But as there are many reasons urged in favor of creeds and
compacts, we may perhaps now, as well as any time, call
them upon the stand in this connection. And&mdash;</p>

<p class='c004'>1st, It is said they had churches in the apostles' day.
True; but the term Church, as Adam Clark says, simply
means an assembly or congregation, the nature of
which is to be understood from connecting circumstances.
Wherever the believers assembled, there was a Church.
Hence we read of a Church at Ephesus, Corinth, &amp;c.
Sometimes the term <i>Church</i> includes the entire company of
believers in every age of the world, as may be seen by
looking at the following passages: Eph. i. 22; v. 24, 25,
27; Col. i. 18, 24; Acts xii. 28. Hence the remark, that
they had churches in the apostles' days, is no argument in
favor of the present existing compacts. There is no intimation
that they had articles drawn up on paper, to which
they subscribed. We go further:&mdash;There is no evidence
that they had a record of names; and, however innocent
this may seem to be, we regard it an innovation. But,</p>

<p class='c004'>2d, It may be remarked that, by being banded together,
we can watch over each other. But we can watch over
each other without these bands; and if we are living and
acting in the fear of God, we shall love each other sufficiently
well to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all long-suffering
and doctrine. And in <i>this</i> way, we shall "lift up
the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees; and, making
straight paths for our feet, that which is lame will not
<a id='Page_11'></a>be turned out of the way." This is a duty we owe to all
the Church; and were it not for these sectarian pens, we
could <i>speak</i> the truth to all the Church. We could watch
over each other in love&mdash;the only <i>true</i> bond of union.
And thus, in loving God with all our hearts, and speaking
the truth in love, "we shall grow up into Christ, from whom
the whole body fitly joined together, and compact by that
which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of
the body unto the edifying of itself in love."</p>

<p class='c004'>3d, <i>It keeps out wicked men</i>.&mdash;This is a most palpable
falsehood. The history of all the past is against it. The
Church, in every age since the apostles' time, hath been
troubled with wicked men. The Saviour taught His disciples
that, "the wheat and the tares should grow together
until the harvest." "And He whose penetrating glance
could trace its progress through the succession of ages, by
this significant parable, in which He represented its condition,
(Matt. 13,) and proclaimed, that it would consist,
according to its earthly composition, of a mixture of true
and false members;" "He reserved the public sifting and
separation of this mass of men, so different in their dispositions
from each other, to his final judgment alone." "He"
has blamed that hasty and intemperate zeal of man, which,
while it would separate the tares and the good seed before
the proper season comes, is apt to pull up the hidden seed of
the wheat with the tares. A great majority of the professed
Church, at the present time, notwithstanding their
organizations, are as corrupt as was the Church in the
dark ages. But,</p>

<p class='c004'>4th, <i>It keeps out heresies</i>.&mdash;If this be so, why did not the
apostles keep out heresy? For we are told by some, at the
present time, that they had creeds and compacts? There
<a id='Page_12'></a>were some in the apostles' time who believed in circumcision.
He, the apostle, inquires of the Galatians, Who
hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth? In
writing his fifteenth chapter to the Corinthians, he inquires,
"Now, if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead,
how say some among you there is no resurrection of the
dead?" These were fatal errors. Again, we inquire, If,
by being organized, the Church can keep out heresy,
why has not the Church kept it out? There never was a
time when there was so much heresy, corruption, and wickedness
as at present. Hundreds of professed Christians
deny the personal coming of Christ: they teach that persons,
when they die, go immediately to heaven; that people
have immortal souls; that the spirits of men, after they are
dead, return to this world; and that they are peeping,
rapping, and muttering, which, by the way, is a <i>legitimate
fruit of the Immortal soul theory;&mdash;a counterpart of that lie
of Satan</i>&mdash;"<span class='sc'>Thou shalt not surely die</span>." These, together
with the idea that heresy may be kept out by human
machinery, are some of the leading errors of the age. But,</p>

<p class='c004'>5th, <i>The ministry is supported</i>.&mdash;I am thinking this is
about the main thing, after all. The loaves and fishes,
with the great mass, are the thing. Did not the Apostle
Peter anticipate the fact that such a class of persons would
arise, when he exhorted the elders to take the oversight,
not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of
a ready mind? The question with the great mass is not,
where can I do the most good?&mdash;but, where can I get the
best pay? The loudest call, is where there is the most
money. These facts are so well known, as not to require
any thing but common observation to demonstrate their
truthfulness. But,</p>

<p class='c004'>6th, <i>To know who</i> <span class='fss'>WE</span> <i>are</i>.&mdash;Satan's course, from the
<a id='Page_13'></a>commencement, has been a most artful and cunning one:
it has been the very business of his existence, when he
could not get people to renounce the truth altogether, to
make them believe it possible to improve a plan which
God, in His infinite wisdom, has devised for the welfare of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The "Jews" (as their history assures us) at first were
willing to be directed by the Almighty; but by and by, they
thought themselves capable of legislating: and being puffed
up in their minds, and having their foolish hearts darkened,
they rejected the Lord; and then coming to Samuel,&mdash;Their
plea&mdash;O how specious, how reasonable!&mdash;"Behold
thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make
us a king, to judge us like other nations." They entertained
fears, undoubtedly, that after Samuel's death, which
was approaching, they should be puzzled to know <span class='fss'>WHO WE
ARE</span>. This very idea led David to number the people, contrary
to the command of Jehovah. And how often it has
been done since that time, to gratify a foolish heart, and a
vain ambition! Would it not have sounded curious enough
to have heard Paul say to Timothy, "Timothy, we must
ascertain, <i>who</i> <span class='fss'>WE</span> <i>are</i>?" And would not the young disciple,
if it was possible for him to fathom it, (for it is a vague
term) replied by saying, "You told the Phillippians that we
were the circumcision, who wanted our names in the Church
book? no; that we were the circumcision, who want to
legislate? no: We are the circumcision, who worship God
in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
in the flesh."</p>

<p class='c004'>Ye, says Christ, "are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you." In order to answer this question fully,
we must, in the first place, answer one that comes before
it&mdash;one that is primary, viz: Do we love God with all our
<a id='Page_14'></a>hearts, and our neighbour as ourselves? Do we live up to
all the commands of God? Are we conformed to His moral
image? Is it the business of our lives to do all that God has
commanded? Are we believing all the truth, and living up
to all the light we have? If so, <span class='fss'>WE ARE</span> Christ's; and being
Christ's, <span class='fss'>WE ARE</span> "Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
the promise." It is not strange that the nominal Church
should lose her identity. But when we hear Adventists inquire,
<i>Who we are</i>, it comes with an ill grace. It sounds
so silly. What! have we been engaged in this glorious
cause fourteen or fifteen years, and never learnt, <i>Who we
are</i>? What does all this mean? Why this effort on the
part of some to organize, and bring in all the Advent bands,
and unite them in a compact? Does this look like a confident,
unwavering faith in the speedy coming of Christ?
Did we not deny, years ago, this miserable work of forming
ourselves into a sect? Hear the <i>Advent Shield and Review</i>,
for Jan., 1845, vol. I. number 2, page 198. It speaks
the language, I will venture to say, of the great majority
of Adventists. Here it is:</p>

<p class='c004'>"<span class='fss'>BUT ADVENTISTS HAVE NO WISH, NO INTENTION, NO NEED
OF CONSTITUTING THEMSELVES INTO A DISTINCT BODY</span>."</p>

<p class='c004'>How is the foregoing to be reconciled with the efforts of
some at the present time, unless there has been a mighty
change? It may be remarked, that circumstances have
driven us to adopt this course. But what are the circumstances?
Is it because of impostors, or heresy? And do
we expect to be free from these by associating ourselves together
in this way? We did not feel the need of any thing
of this kind in forty-two and three: Our hearts were united
in the bonds of love; and if this bond has been severed,
instead of fixing up something as a substitute&mdash;something
that is contrary to the word of God&mdash;we should, by preaching
<a id='Page_15'></a>the simple truth, remove the cause, and "nature" (Grace)
"would work its own cure." But no; we must have our
creeds, our organizations, our conferences, and our delegates
to those conferences. And then, having ascertained,
<span class='fss'>WHO WE ARE</span>, we are prepared to act. But act how? Why,
we can "shear off the troublesome thinkers."</p>

<p class='c004'>But it will be remarked that this is not the design, and
that it is wrong to judge our brethren in this way. But
we may remark that it is so already&mdash;the mystery of iniquity
doth already work. The very design of organizations,
in the common acceptation of that term, and also of
creeds, is to proscribe individual liberty; they are opposed
to free action. It will not do for a man to act in accordance
with the commission, "Go ye into all the world, and preach
the Gospel to every creature." No, he must preach to our
party&mdash;to our people. To illustrate this principle, we quote
the following from the life of Lorenzo Dow:</p>

<p class='c005'>"A Preacher from America, whose name is Lorenzo Dow, travelled
lately in Ireland, without any official recommendation from the American
Conferences, or any of the rulers in that connection, and yet professing
himself a friend of the Methodists. What judgment is it expedient
for this conference to pass concerning the conduct of that man?"
"<i>Ans.</i> WE ARE MOST SINCERE FRIENDS TO RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY; but we consider ourselves called upon to inform the public,
that Mr. Dow has no connexion with us, nor did he receive the
least permission or encouragement from the conference to travel through
Ireland as one of our body, or as one of our friends; and we are determined,
that if he returns to this country, none of our preaching-houses
shall be opened to him on any account." Again, "letters of falsehood
and lies, to set the government to sacrifice an individual on the altar of
tyranny, because he goes so independent of the <span class='sc'>BISHOP's</span> POWER;
and others will" (do) "hatch from the same nest, &amp;c. &amp;c."...
"Better one suffer than many. If he is innocent, we must use POWER,
and make an example of him. What for? As a warning to others
not to dispute our power, which, if right, <i>we</i> have by Divine delegation,
to enforce, 'MORAL DISCIPLINE!'"</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_16'></a>The question is not, what does Christ require?&mdash;but,
what says the bishop? Now, we would say nothing, but for
the fact, that the same principle is developing itself in our
own ranks. This <i>miserable</i> creed system is now exerting
upon Adventists an unsuspected, but tremendous power
against the liberty of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is stealthily creeping upon us. May God unscale our
eyes, before we get entangled in the meshes of the net of
the Devil! "It is true, each denomination says, we inflict
no penalty; we only decline to receive into our ranks one
who does not agree with us. And this is so specious, it
sounds so reasonable, that it might deceive the very elect.
But it is the most consummate stroke of infernal craft, and
doubly distilled Jesuitism. It is like Rome handing over
the victims of the Inquisition to the civil arm, charging it
to do them no harm, and then piously lauding her own lamb-like
disposition. It is true, the denominations do not do the
candidate any harm; they only leave him to his inevitable
fate." But it may be remarked, that it is of no use to say
any thing about it; and should the individual lift his warning
voice against it, he is accused of having a hard spirit&mdash;of
opposing somebody. But we wish it distinctly understood,
that we are not at war with persons, but principles; not
with men, but measures. We wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world, against <i>spiritual
wickedness in high places</i>. We are opposed to these religious
combinations, because we believe they are opposed to
God and His cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>To give this idea more perfectly, we submit the following
extract from the pen of Br. J. V. H. (<i>Advent Herald</i>,
September 18, 1844,) headed, "<span class='sc'>Apostolic Example for
our Course</span>."</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_17'></a>"And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God. But when <i>divers</i> were <i>hardened</i> and <span class='fss'>BELIEVED NOT</span>,
BUT SPAKE EVIL OF THAT WAY BEFORE THE MULTITUDE,
he departed from them, and SEPARATED the disciples, disputing
daily in the school of one Tyrannus.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> xix. 8, 9. "It was
not until <i>divers were hardened</i>, and spake evil of <i>that way</i> (the Lord's
coming) <i>before the multitude</i>, that the brethren were moved to come
out, and separate from the Churches. They could not endure this
"evil speaking" of the "evil servant." "<i>And the Churches that
could pursue this course of oppression</i>" and "evil speaking" "towards
those who were looking for the blessed hope, were to them none other
than the <span class='fss'>DAUGHTERS</span> of <span class='sc'>mystic Babylon</span>. <span class='sc'>They so proclaimed them,
and came into the liberty of the gospel.</span> And though we may not be
all agreed as to what constitutes Babylon, <i>we are agreed in the</i> <span class='fss'>INSTANT</span>
<i>and</i> <span class='fss'>FINAL SEPARATION</span> <i>from all who oppose the doctrine of the coming
and kingdom of God at hand. We believe it to be a case of</i> LIFE
and DEATH. It is <span class='fss'>DEATH</span> <i>to remain connected with those bodies</i> that
speak lightly of, or oppose, the coming of the Lord. <i>It is</i> <span class='fss'>LIFE</span> <i>to come
out from</i> <span class='fss'>ALL HUMAN TRADITION</span>, <i>and stand upon the word of God, and
look daily for the appearance of the Lord. We therefore now say to</i>
<span class='fss'>ALL</span> <i>who are in</i> ANY <span class='fss'>WAY</span> <i>entangled in the yoke of bondage</i>," "Come
out from among them, and be ye <i>separate</i>, saith the Lord, and touch
not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto
you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."&mdash;2
Cor. vi. 17, 18.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'>AMEN</span> and <span class='fss'>AMEN</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>2d, These "creeds" and compacts are opposed to free
speech. One great object of creeds is a union of sentiment.
Hence, when a man joins any one of the various denominations,
the creed is presented, or the question asked, do you
believe so and so? Should he dissent in some particulars,
yet being an influential or wealthy person, he may join by
promising he will not agitate the points of difference. But
let us look at another case. Here is a minister&mdash;and, by
the way, there has been many of them&mdash;who embraces the
truth of the Lord's speedy coming; it is as fire shut up in
<a id='Page_18'></a>his bones; he comes with the joyful intelligence before his
congregation, and in the fulness of his soul he preaches that
truth, which is the power of God unto salvation to every
one that believeth; and in less than one week he is waited
upon by the bishop, or the committee, or peradventure, he
receives a line through the office, informing him he must
desist, for it is contrary to the <i>standards</i> of the Church, and
as such, we ("Elders," "Bishops" and "Deacons") are
pledged to banish it away. If he persists, he must be admonished.
If he continues to act the part of a man and a
Christian, turn him out&mdash;"yes, shear off the troublesome
thinkers, and sing stagnant hallelujahs."</p>

<p class='c004'>But we may come nearer home. How often we hear it
remarked, "Don't say any thing about the sonship of Christ&mdash;the
sleep of the dead&mdash;the destruction of the wicked; for,
if you do, you will hurt somebody's feelings!" Yes; we
have men among us who have declared, that these questions
shall not be preached in their pulpits. But the question
may be asked, "Have we not a right to say what shall, and
what shall not, be preached in our pulpits? and shall we
not use our utmost endeavors to keep the Church pure?"
Well, now, this looks very reasonable, and were it not for
the history of the past, we might regard it as being very
innocent. But we look to the "council of bishops," who
met A.D. 325: they acted from a conviction, that it was
their prerogative to say what should be preached: and by
this act, though honest and sincere, they were the unconscious
tools, in the hands of the devil, of begetting a child,
which ultimately proved itself to be, the "<span class='sc'>Mother</span> of <span class='fss'>HARLOTS</span>
and abomination of the earth." May the Lord help
us to be free, and preach our sentiments! "For he's a
freeman whom the truth makes free, and all are slaves
beside." But,</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_19'></a>3d, <i>The few act for the whole</i>.&mdash;Look to the history of
the Christian Church&mdash;the Council of Nice, Chalcedon, &amp;c.
Who acted in these conferences? <i>Ans.</i> A few bishops.
They got together; resolved that they were the Church, or
its representatives; made creeds, and then imposed them on
the flock. This has been the policy of Rome; for hundreds
of years her Popes and Cardinals, Bishops and Priests, have
been humbugging the people, hurling their anathemas at a
Luther and a Cranmer. Why is this? <i>Ans.</i> Because
they dared to dissent from the decrees of those councils.
But we do not stop here; that spirit, or desire to lord it
over God's heritage, which characterized the councils of
Rome, has been transferred to the various synods of our
time. It is often the case, that a few persons get together,
take into consideration the <i>wants of the cause</i>, as they call
it, reduce them to one or more propositions, and then bring
them before the meeting. Perhaps one of this number
makes a motion, and another of them seconds it; it is accepted,
then adopted by the votes of ten or a dozen, more
or less; half of whom are the very persons who concocted
it. It is then blazoned abroad, and O! what a bluster!
When the merits of the case are known, it reminds one of
the fable, "The mountain laboured, and brought forth a
mouse."</p>

<p class='c004'>4th, <i>It evinces a want of faith and confidence in God</i>.&mdash;Creeds
are never talked of, until persons begin to grow
cold in their minds. "The Church, during the whole of
the first century, had no creed but the Bible;" but when
she departed from the simplicity of the Bible, and lost her
faith in God, then she began to legislate.&mdash;They (the church)
felt, as many express themselves at the present time, that
we must keep the Church together. Yes, and here was,
and still is, the very trouble: <span class='fss'>WE MUST DO IT</span>. This is not
<a id='Page_20'></a>our work; it belongs to the Great Head of the Church;
and if we had faith and confidence in God, and in His
word, we should be willing to let Christ do His own work.
Every effort to keep the Church together by making creeds,
is an innovation.&mdash;There were divisions in the apostles'
day, and there have been divisions in every age since that
time. Every effort on our part to steady the Ark, when
such effort has not been put forth in accordance with the
plan of God, has been frowned upon by the Almighty. It
is often the case that those who seem to have so much
anxiety, and manifest so much zeal to hold and to "build
up the cause," as they are pleased to term it, are, when the
truth is known, trying to build up themselves. While it
is our duty to do all we can, under the blessing of Heaven,
to promote the welfare of the cause with which we are
associated, we must be careful not to indulge a thought
that its prosperity depends upon our feeble efforts: for <i>it</i>
will live, whether we do or not. Christ stands at the helm,
and, if we abide in the ship, we shall be safe. But the
creed-power, or "organizations," in the common acceptation
of the term, are not only opposed to free action&mdash;free
speech&mdash;But,</p>

<p class='c004'>Lastly, <i>It is the most effective means to destroy souls
of any thing that was ever brought into existence</i>. The
professed church to-day stands just where the Jews did
eighteen hundred years ago; and the language of Christ,
as addressed to the Pharisees, is applicable to the various
denominations: "But woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of Heaven against
men: for ye neither go in <i>yourselves</i>, neither suffer ye
them that are entering to go in." Fine meeting-houses,
costly pulpits, and a ministry that will please itching ears,
are the things with the great mass. They are guilty of turning
<a id='Page_21'></a>the Lord out of doors, for they have rejected His truth.
"Ichabod" is written on these pleasant palaces. The
great majority of the ministry are dumb dogs, lying down,
loving to slumber; yea, <i>they are</i> greedy dogs, <i>which</i> can
never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot
understand: "they all look to their own way, every one
for his gain from his quarter." They are turned unto
fables. "They love the praise of man more than the praise
of God."</p>

<p class='c004'>The great mass have corrupted their way; but yet
there are a few who are honest, and would believe if they
could hear, and they could hear, if it were not for these
<span class='fss'>SECTARIAN PENS</span>. They (the few) are famishing; they die
for lack of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Well, now, to take one step towards adopting a system,
the perfection of which leads to such <i>damnable results</i>,
must be a <i>departure</i> from the simplicity of the truth&mdash;a
recreancy to the cause which, in the end, will be more
<i>baneful</i> than beneficial.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of those who want a record of names would shudder
at the idea of being connected with such a system as
that referred to above; and yet, in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred, this is the result where the first step is taken.
We say, therefore, to all, "Beware of the first step! Do
not give your influence in favor of such a wicked system,
lest you be taken in a snare! If you are in any of these
sectarian pens, leave them at once; for they, like Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram, are soon to sink into the pit. Those
that are being formed by Adventists, are no better than
other denominations. In some respects they are worse."</p>

<p class='c004'>There are men among us, preaching brethren, whose
moral and religious characters are unimpeachable&mdash;men
of sterling worth, and of marked ability; yet, because
<a id='Page_22'></a>they view matters somewhat different from some others, or
because they will not be restricted to preach wholly to our
party, they are disfellowshipped; they are whispered to be
<i>unsafe</i>, <i>unsound</i>, <i>heretical</i>! But some may say, that it is
of no use to expose our brethren;&mdash;ah, to hold our peace
would be to follow in the same track&mdash;to adopt the same
policy of an apostate church. We wish our brethren to
know, both far and near, that this is the policy of some at
the present time. We have nothing to say against men,
but against their courses and their measures. Let every
Adventist, who wants to be free, beware of this <i>human
machinery&mdash;these sectarian pens</i>&mdash;this last effort of Satan
to destroy souls. We cannot help but exclaim, in the
language of a "celebrated writer:" "Oh, woful day! Oh,
unhappy Church of Christ! Fast rushing round the fatal
circle of absorbing ruin! Thou sayest, 'I am rich, and
increased in goods, and have need of nothing;' and <i>knowest</i>
not that thou art poor, and miserable, and <i>blind</i>, and
naked!" We have said, and we repeat it again, there is
no need of any creed but the Bible: we have learned that
it is a sufficient rule of faith and practice: it is the best
discipline we can have: and I will venture to say that, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, all difficulties can be
settled, if we follow out the rules given by Christ and His
apostles. Let us hear the Saviour speak: "Therefore, if
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift
before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift."&mdash;Matt. v. 23,
24. Again, we read, "And when ye stand praying, forgive,
if ye have aught against any: that your Father also
which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."&mdash;Mark
xi. 24. "Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass
<a id='Page_23'></a>against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and
him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
brother. But if he will not hear <i>thee</i>, <i>then</i> take with thee
one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses
every word may be established. And if he shall
neglect to hear them, tell <i>it</i> unto the Church; but if he
neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican."&mdash;Matt. xviii. 15-17. The
apostle says, "And if any obey not our word by this epistle,
note that man, and have no company with him, that he
may be ashamed; yet count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother.&mdash;2 Thes. iii. 14, 15.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above, together with many more scriptures that might
be quoted, involves the principle on which brethren are to
settle their difficulties. And when the professed Church
of God, instead of urging the necessity of abiding by the
above principle, departs from the Lord, by appointing committees
to settle the differences between brethren, they are
guilty of the most audacious folly. If difficulties cannot
be settled by this rule, nothing will settle them but the final
judgment.</p>

<p class='c004'>We say, then, in the language of Beecher, "Away with
false policy! Rally around this central principle, look to
the Lord, and you are impregnable." The waves of the
coming conflict, which is to convulse Christendom to her
centre, are beginning to be felt.</p>

<p class='c004'>The deep roarings begin to swell beneath us. All the
old signs fail. God answers no more by Urim and Thummim,
nor by dream, nor by prophet. Men's hearts are
failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that
are coming on the earth. Thunders mutter in the distance;
winds moan across the raging bosom of the deep; all things
betide the rising of that final storm of Divine indignation,
<a id='Page_24'></a>which shall sweep away the vain refuges of lies. When
the Lord shall cause His glorious voice to be heard, and shall
show the lightning down His arm, with the indignation of
His anger, and with the flame of devouring fire; with
scattering, and tempest, and hail-stones; in that day, what
shall save us? For judgment will begin at the house of
God. What shall be our defence? Put your trust in Him
whose eyes are as a flame of fire&mdash;on whose head are
many crowns&mdash;who is clothed with a vesture dipped in
blood&mdash;whose name is called "<span class='sc'>The Word of God</span>!" He
who is to come down, and tread upon the high places of the
earth, trampling His enemies in the dust, destroying the
works of Satan, breaking up all these compacts which are
opposed to His truth, establishing his everlasting kingdom,
which is not to be left to another people, but which is to
break in pieces all other kingdoms, and it shall stand for
ever. Even so, Lord Jesus! Come quickly!&mdash;<span class='sc'>Amen.</span></p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
